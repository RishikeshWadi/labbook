# Week 1: Networking Challenge
Welcome to Week 1 of the 90 Days of DevOps

## Tasks

## 1. **Understand OSI & TCP/IP Models**

### What is the OSI Model?
- The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection)was developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).
- It is a set of rules that explains how different computer systems communicate with each other over a network. 
- The OSI Model consists of 7 layers and each layer has specific functions and responsibilities.

### Layers of OSI Model:

**Application Layer (Layer 7)**
  - Interface for end-user applications to communicate over a network. This is the only layer that directly interacts with data from the user.
  - **Example:**
    - HTTP: When you browse a website (opening Google.com).
    - SMTP: Sending an email using Gmail.

**Presentation Layer (Layer 6)**
  - This layer is primarily responsible for preparing data so that it can be used by the application layer.
  - The presentation layer is responsible for translation, encryption, and compression of data.
  - The presentation layer is also called the Translation layer.
  - **Example:**
    - SSL/TLS: Secure data transfer in HTTPS.
    - JPEG, MP3: Compressing images and audio files before sending.

**Session Layer (Layer 5)**
  - This is the layer that Manages and controls connections between applications (opening and closing communication between the two devices).
  - The time between when the communication is opened and closed is known as the session.
  - **Example:**
    - OAuth Authentication: Logging into a website using Google/Facebook.
    - Calls: Maintaining an active call session.
   
**Transport Layer (Layer 4)**
  - Layer 4 ensures reliable data transmission. This includes taking data from the session layer and breaking it up into chunks called segments before sending it to Layer 3.
  - The data in the transport layer is referred to as Segments.
  - The transport layer is also responsible for flow control and error control.
  - **Example:**
    - TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): Ensures file downloads are complete and error-free.
    - UDP (User Datagram Protocol): Live video streaming, where some data loss is acceptable.

**Network Layer (Layer 3)**
  - The network layer provides transmission of data from one host to the other located in different networks.
  -  The network layer breaks up segments from the transport layer into smaller units, called packets.
  -  It also determines the best route for data transfer.
  - **Example:**
    - IP (Internet Protocol): Assigns unique addresses (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
    - Routers: Direct data between networks.

**Data Link Layer (Layer 2)**
  -  The data link layer handles data transfer between two devices on the same network. (data transfer between directly connected devices.)
  - The data link layer takes packets from the network layer and breaks them into smaller pieces called frames.
  - **Example:**
    - MAC Addresses: Identifying devices in a local network.
    - Ethernet & Wi-Fi: Connecting a laptop to a router.

**Physical Layer (Layer 1)**
  - It includes the actual physical connection between the devices.
  - The physical layer contains information in the form of bits and then transmits individual bits from one node to the next.
  - When receiving data, this layer will get the signal received and convert it into 0s and 1s and send them to the Data Link layer,
  - **Example:**
    - Fiber Optic Cables: Used for high-speed internet.
    - Wi-Fi Signals: Wireless connectivity.

**-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

### What is the TCP/IP Model?
- TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, which are the core protocols of the Internet.
- It is a set of protocols that define how data should be transmitted over a network by ensuring reliable communication between devices.
- It consists of four layers: the Link Layer, the Internet Layer, the Transport Layer, and the Application Layer.

### Layers of TCP/IP Model:

**Application Layer (Layer 4)**
  - The Application Layer in the TCP/IP model combines the functions of three layers from the OSI model: the Application, Presentation, and Session layers.
  - Deals with application-level protocols like HTTP, FTP, SMTP, and DNS, directly enabling communication between networked applications.
  - **Example:**
    - HTTP/HTTPS: Web browsing.
    - DNS: Resolving domain names to IP addresses.

**Transport Layer (Layer 3)**
  - Corresponds to the OSI's Transport layer.
  - Provides end-to-end communication, ensuring reliable data delivery with protocols like TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).
  - **Example:**
    - TCP: Downloading a file.
    - UDP: Watching a YouTube video.
  
**Network or Internet Layer (Layer 2)**
  - Corresponds to the OSI's Network layer.
  - Responsible for logical addressing and routing of data across networks using protocols like IP (Internet Protocol).
  - **Example:**
    -  IP: Assigning unique addresses to devices.
    - ICMP: Checking network connectivity.
   
**Network Access Layer or Link Layer (Layer 1)**
  - Combines the functions of OSI's Physical and Data Link layers.
  - Deals with the physical connection and data transfer over network hardware (e.g., Ethernet).
  - **Example:**
    - Ethernet & Wi-Fi: Connecting to a network.
    - MAC Address Filtering: Restricting network access.

## 2. **Protocols and Ports for DevOps**
Networking Protocols and Ports enable communication between systems, ensure secure data transmission, and facilitate automation.

**Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)**
  - used to transfer data over the web, web communication, transferring web pages, and REST API interactions.
  - **Port** 80 (Port 80 is the default port for HTTP traffic.)
  - *Example:*
    - Enables CI/CD pipelines to interact with web applications.
    - Used for monitoring services and fetching build artifacts.

**Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)**
  - Secure version of HTTP that encrypts communication using SSL/TLS.
  - **Port:** 443
  - *Example:*
    - Ensures secure API interactions.
    - Critical for deploying applications securely over the web

**File Transfer Protocol (FTP)**
  - FTP is used to transfer files between systems over a network.
  - **Port:** 21
  - *Example:*
    - Used for automating file transfers in legacy systems.
    - Sometimes used for deploying artifacts in non-cloud environments.

**Secure Shell (SSH)**
  - SSH is used to provide secure remote access to systems.
  - **Port:** 22
  - *Example:*
    - Essential for automating deployments and managing infrastructure.
    - Used in remote server administration and configuration management.

**Domain Name System (DNS)**
  - resolves and translates domain names into IP addresses
  - **Port:** 53
  - *Example:*
    - Used in service discovery for microservices.
    -  Helps automate DNS configurations in infrastructure-as-code setups.

**Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)**
  - Sends emails between mail servers.
  - **Port:** 25
  - *Example:*
   - Used for sending automated notifications and alerts from CI/CD pipelines.

**Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)**
  - Manages and accesses directory information.
  - **Port:** 389 (unencrypted), 636 (SSL/TLS encrypted)
  - *Example:*
    - Used for authentication and access control in DevOps pipelines.

**Network Time Protocol (NTP)**
  - Synchronizes system clocks.
  - **Port:** 123
  - *Example:*
    - Ensures time consistency across distributed systems and logs.
